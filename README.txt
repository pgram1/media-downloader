downloader.bat is a Windows utility script that uses 
youtube-dl to download video and audio files from famous websites, such as Youtube.

You first input the URL of the video or audio source you found and want to download.
Playlists are also supported, so it is wise to create a Youtube playlist of the videos you want to download and then
they will be downloaded in bulk by the utility.

After the downloading process is done, the videos are converted to mp4, which is the most widely compatible
file format for media. This ensures that they will be eligible for re-upload and playback on a vast range of different devices.
The conversion process can be quite lengthy on an older machine but could be stopped if need be.
A not fully converted file will not be played back though
and you'll have to delete it manually.

All finished files are stored in a folder under your Downloads Windows folder. It is advised, but not needed, to empty that folder
every time before you run the script.
